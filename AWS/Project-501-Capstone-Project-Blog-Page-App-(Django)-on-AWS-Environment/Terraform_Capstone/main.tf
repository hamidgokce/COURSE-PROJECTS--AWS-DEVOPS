  # write your certficate arn for https secure connection used by Cloudfront. Be careful!!! Even though you create this stack any region except us-east-1, Cloudfront needs the certificate issued in us-east-1 region. Thts why, if you create this stack in us-east-1, you can use your certificate issued in this region, but if you create this stack in different region, you have to use a certificate isuued in us-east-1.
